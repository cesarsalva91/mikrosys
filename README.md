# mikrosys
This project presents a modular architecture for the automated deployment and configuration of MikroTik devices. It is designed to optimize administrative tasks, ensure secure access, and support system scalability.

The system functions as a Deployment Engine or Provisioning System, enabling centralized and automated management of common configurations (such as NAT, SNMP, NTP, ROMON, etc.) through a secure web interface.
